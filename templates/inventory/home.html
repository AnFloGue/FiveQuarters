    <h1>Project Overview: Five Quarters</h1>
    <p>Five Quarters is a supplier back-end shop that manages the production of products for various front-end franchises. The system is designed to streamline the ordering and manufacturing process, ensuring that franchises can quickly and efficiently obtain the products they need.</p>

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul class="feature-list">
        <li id="home">
            <strong>Home Page:</strong> Displays "Products of the Week" which are pre-made and can be ordered immediately without any waiting time.
        </li>
        <li id="products">
            <strong>Products Page:</strong> Franchise owners can order made-to-order products from this page. Each product is sorted into categories that align with existing ones and includes a detailed recipe showing the required ingredients and potential allergens.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Order Fulfillment Notification:</strong> The system checks the stock and notifies the franchise owner about the availability of the order. If the stock is insufficient, it provides an estimated waiting time.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Upon order placement, the system alerts the inventory administrator to restock items if they are below the designated minimum level.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Information:</strong> Access detailed recipes for each product, including all ingredients and potential allergens.</li>
                <li><strong>Reviews and Popularity Index:</strong> Franchise owners can view all reviews and check the popularity index based on previous orders.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="inventory">
            <strong>Internal Inventory System:</strong> Monitors overall stock levels and notifies the administration if there are insufficient ingredients to fulfill an order, ensuring the inventory is always up-to-date.
        </li>
        <li id="user-feedback">
            <strong>User Feedback:</strong> Franchises can rate products and leave comments to help improve product quality.
        </li>
        <li id="user-management">
            <strong>User Management:</strong> Provides web pages for user registration, login, and account management for different members who have access to the system. There are two tiers of user roles:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users in this tier have the possibility of having up to all administrative permissions.</li>
                        <li>They can manage inventory, reorder supplies, and perform other backend administrative actions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Franchise Owner:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users in this tier can only place orders, cancel orders, and view pages.</li>
                        <li>They do not have access to change inventory or reorder supplies, or perform any typical actions that only the inventory management backend users would do.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>API-First Approach:</h2>
    <ul class="api-features">
        <li><strong>Centralized Logic:</strong> Ensures consistency in data access and modification.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Uniform application of authentication and authorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Easier to scale and maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Front-end and back-end can evolve independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Easier Testing and Monitoring:</strong> Simplifies testing, monitoring, and debugging.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures uniform data manipulation rules and validations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works:</h2>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Product Information and Feedback:</strong> Detailed recipes and ingredient information are available for each product. Franchise owners can view reviews and popularity indices to make informed decisions. User feedback is collected to improve product quality.
        </li>
